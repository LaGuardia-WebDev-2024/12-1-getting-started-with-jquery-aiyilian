## Directions

### Step #1 - Include jQuery <br>

It's time for your first jQuery challenge! <br><br>
Start by adding a `<script>` tag that points at the jQuery JS file that is located at `https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js` <br><br> The `<script>` tag should be the final tag in your page, right before the closing `</body>` tag.
<br><br>
_Hint:_
`<script src="..."></script>`
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Add another script tag <br>
Now add an empty `<script>` tag. You will use this one to write JS that uses jQuery, so you should put it under the `<script>` tag that brings in the jQuery library.
<br><br>
_Hint:_
`<script>`
`</script>`

### Step #3 - Replace the headings using jQuery <br>
Inside the second `<script>` tag, use the line of code that we showed you to replace the headings with 'Web Dev is the best'. 
<br><br>We will explain much more about how that line of code works in the next talk-through.
<br><br>
_Hint:_
`$(h1).text()`
